# node modules
Let's talk briefly about the node_modules folder.  Again, everything you install in a project get's install here.  Feel free to navigate into the `node_modules/` folder and look around.

When your program has many depedencies, sometimes it's helpful see all of the packages that are helping to run your app behind the scenes.  To help demonstrate, install the package `nomnom` per your prior learning, then run `npm ls`.  This will show the dependency tree as npm scans your `node_modules` folder.

```bash
$ npm ls
t@1.0.0 /Users/cdieringer/node/t
├── colors@1.1.1
└─┬ nomnom@1.8.1
  ├─┬ chalk@0.4.0
  │ ├── ansi-styles@1.0.0
  │ ├── has-color@0.1.7
  │ └── strip-ansi@0.1.1
  └── underscore@1.6.0
```

Look at that. `colors` has _no depdendencies_.  That generally means a package is written in pure javascript, or has a build process (which is an advanced topic).  `nomnom` depends on `chalk`, and we can see that `chalk` depends on three other packages.  I wonder what `chalk` does?  Turns out, almost _the same thing_ as `colors`!  Many similiar packages exist on npm, which is often helpful as one may not offer the exact features that you need.  If you need to keep the size of your application down, perhaps if you were building a browser application, you may try and eliminate redundancy.  If you are doing such a thing, you may check out [npm dedupe](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dedupe) or npm3.
