# closing remarks
This barely scratches the surface of `npm`!  Hopefully you played and tinkered as we went along.  If things didn't go as planned, you have questions, found bugs, or would like modified content, make sure to send a tweet out to [@cdaringe](https://twitter.com/cdaringe)!

Of course, you are free to edit as seen fit [over on github](https://github.com/cdaringe/try-npm-guide/) as well!

Thanks :)
