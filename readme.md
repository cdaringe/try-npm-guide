## A command line tutorial to learn `npm`

This repo contains the content for the workshop. `npm` and `node` come pre-installed.  Open the page and run!

Then follow the instructions from each markdown (`.md`) file in this repo, in order.

The legwork for the infrastructure of this app is heavily credited to @mafintosh && @maxogden!  See [adventure-time](https://github.com/maxogden/adventure-time/) to see how to build your own :).
