<p>Let&#39;s talk briefly about the node_modules folder.  Again, everything you install in a project get&#39;s install here.  Feel free to navigate into the <code>node_modules/</code> folder and look around.</p>
<p>When your program has many depedencies, sometimes it&#39;s helpful see all of the packages that are helping to run your app behind the scenes.  To help demonstrate, install the package <code>nomnom</code> per your prior learning, then run <code>npm ls</code>.  This will show the dependency tree as npm scans your <code>node_modules</code> folder.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ npm ls
t@1.0.0 /Users/cdieringer/node/t
├── colors@1.1.1
└─┬ nomnom@1.8.1
  ├─┬ chalk@0.4.0
  │ ├── ansi-styles@1.0.0
  │ ├── has-color@0.1.7
  │ └── strip-ansi@0.1.1
  └── underscore@1.6.0
</code></pre>
<p>Look at that. <code>colors</code> has <em>no depdendencies</em>.  That generally means a package is written in pure javascript, or has a build process (which is an advanced topic).  <code>nomnom</code> depends on <code>chalk</code>, and we can see that <code>chalk</code> depends on three other packages.  I wonder what <code>chalk</code> does?  Turns out, almost <em>the same thing</em> as <code>colors</code>!  Many similiar packages exist on npm, which is often helpful is one doesn&#39;t do exactly what you expect.  If you need to keep the size of your application down, perhaps if you were building a browser application, you may try and eliminate redundancy.  If you are doing such a thing, you may check out <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dedupe">npm dedupe</a> or npm3.</p>
